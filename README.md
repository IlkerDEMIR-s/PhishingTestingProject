## Aim

   The project is centered on the development of a Phishing Testing Platform, an essential tool for understanding and mitigating the risks associated with real-world phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are a pervasive and evolving threat in today’s digital landscape, often leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and substantial financial loss.The primary objective of our project is to devise a comprehensive solution that enables users to simulate and identify phishing attempts. This simulation feature is particularly crucial as it provides users with a secure environment to gain practical experience and understanding of phishing tactics without the associated risks.By identifying phishing attempts, users can learn to distinguish between legitimate and malicious communications, thereby enhancing their overall cybersecurity awareness. This knowledge is invaluable in today’s digital age, where phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.In the long term, the platform aims to strengthen users’ defenses against such threats. By continuously learning and adapting to new phishing strategies through the platform, users can stay one step ahead of potential attackers. This continuous learning process is key to maintaining robust security in the face of evolving threats.
